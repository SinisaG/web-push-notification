## Web-push-notificatio

#### Idea

This is just a simple demo, how one can trigger push notifications on the web. The project is using `VAPID` for auth 
and should work in Firefox and Chrome.

#### Start the project

To run the project locally, close it and then

```javascript
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```
